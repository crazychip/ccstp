alertme.sh
----------
alertme.sh was something I knocked together quickly to send me an email with cron. I use it to
remind me that it's time to check the logs and other things. Probably many other ways this could be 
done, but I was simultaniously learning shellscript.

datecp.sh
---------
datecp.sh is a script I found when learning to make shell scripts, and found use for on my servers.
Some times I just want to quickly take a backup of some file or folder. And I have usually ended up with
file.old then it will be file.old2 etc. With this little gem I get a slightly more useful suffix.

backup_world.sh
---------------
backup_world.sh is a minecraft world backup script. It sends commands to the java ui runnning in screen
and makes timestamed tar.gz files in a backup directory.
